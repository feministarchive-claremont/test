This archive will be a collection of feminist, disability studies, critical race studies, gender studies, and queer studies student projects at the Claremont Colleges. It is meant to serve as a way to value knowledge production from those often excluded from scholarly conversation and allow future generations of students learn from past students. We encourage all students to submit their work in related subjects!
